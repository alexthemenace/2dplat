Note: hard break\n indication may go away, this may not be useful in actual application.\n If end of leaf is found, return leaf's len. This does not indicate\n a break, as that requires at least one more codepoint of context.\n If it is a break, then subsequent next call will return an offset of\n 0. EOT is always a break, so in the EOT case it's up to the caller\n to figure that out.","sig":null,"attributes":[]}],"impls":[{"id":0,"kind":"Direct","span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":2668,"byte_end":2685,"line_start":70,"line_end":70,"column_start":23,"column_end":40},"value":"","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":32},{"krate":0,"index":34}],"docs":"","sig":null,"attributes":[]},{"id":1,"kind":"Inherent","span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":3723,"byte_end":3740,"line_start":100,"line_end":100,"column_start":10,"column_end":27},"value":"","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":38}],"docs":"","sig":null,"attributes":[]},{"id":2,"kind":"Direct","span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":4935,"byte_end":4952,"line_start":134,"line_end":134,"column_start":18,"column_end":35},"value":"","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":42}],"docs":"","sig":null,"attributes":[]},{"id":3,"kind":"Inherent","span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":5219,"byte_end":5236,"line_start":145,"line_end":145,"column_start":6,"column_end":23},"value":"","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":46},{"krate":0,"index":48}],"docs":"","sig":null,"attributes":[]}],"refs":[],"macro_refs":[],"relations":[{"span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":2668,"byte_end":2685,"line_start":70,"line_end":70,"column_start":23,"column_end":40},"kind":{"variant":"Impl","fields":[0]},"from":{"krate":0,"index":50},"to":{"krate":2,"index":4316}},{"span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":3723,"byte_end":3740,"line_start":100,"line_end":100,"column_start":10,"column_end":27},"kind":{"variant":"Impl","fields":[1]},"from":{"krate":0,"index":50},"to":{"krate":4294967295,"index":4294967295}},{"span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":4935,"byte_end":4952,"line_start":134,"line_end":134,"column_start":18,"column_end":35},"kind":{"variant":"Impl","fields":[2]},"from":{"krate":0,"index":58},"to":{"krate":2,"index":2632}},{"span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,75,117,109,97,114,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,120,105,45,117,110,105,99,111,100,101,45,48,46,49,46,48,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":5219,"byte_end":5236,"line_start":145,"line_end":145,"column_start":6,"column_end":23},"kind":{"variant":"Impl","fields":[3]},"from":{"krate":0,"index":58},"to":{"krate":4294967295,"index":4294967295}}]}
