# Codename: Dune
An action 2D platformer made with the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) game engine.

This is my *firstish* attempt at a game (I did write a basic snake game some time back). Through this project, I aim to get better at coding in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), get familiar with the Amethyst game engine and start learning game development in general. I also hope that this project will help other Amethyst and game dev beginners like me in some way or the other.

Currently, it is a :warning:**WORK IN PROGRESS**:warning: and there is still a lot to be done before it reaches a playable state. Also, the code is far from perfect and there is a lot of scope for improvement. I will keep enhancing the code incrementally, as I go along. 

## Running the game
