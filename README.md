# Space Menace

![](demo.gif)


An action 2D platformer made with the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) game engine.

This is my _firstish_ attempt at a game (I did write a basic snake game some time back). Through this project, I aim to get better at coding in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), get familiar with the Amethyst game engine and start learning game development in general. I also hope that this project will help other Amethyst and game dev beginners like me in some way or the other.

Currently, it is a :warning:**WORK IN PROGRESS**:warning: and there is still a lot to be done before it reaches a playable state. Also, the code is far from perfect and there is a lot of scope for improvement. I will keep enhancing the code incrementally, as I go along.

## Configure Cargo.toml

The default render target feature is set to `metal` for macOS users.

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[features]
default = ["metal"]
metal = ["amethyst/metal"]
vulkan = ["amethyst/vulkan"]
```

If you are on Windows or Linux, you will have to set that default to `vulkan`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[features]
default = ["vulkan"]
# ...
```

## Running the game

**Note:** This game requires Rust nightly

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/amethyst/space-menace.git
cd space-menace

# Set the toolchain to nightly for the current directory
rustup override set nightly

# Run
cargo run â€”release
```

## Game controls

Use the `left arrow` key and `right arrow` key to move the player and the `up arrow` key to jump. Use `spacebar` to fire.

## Features:

- [x] Basic map using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- [x] Animation using prefabs (Main character run, jump, shoot, etc.)
- [x] Basic 2D physics (gravity, velocity, collision detection, etc.)
- [x] Lazy spawning of entities
- [x] Parallax
- [ ] One complete level (enemies, full map, etc.)
- [ ] Start, Pause and Game Over screens
- [ ] Game mechanics / rules (points, lives, etc.)
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Consider [nphysics](https://nphysics.org/) integration (using [specs-physics](https://github.com/amethyst/specs-physics/))
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests

More details about the features, **roadmap** and the game in general can be found [here on Amethyst's discourse](https://community.amethyst.rs/c/showcase/space-menace).
